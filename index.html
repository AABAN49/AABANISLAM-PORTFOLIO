    <h2>Who I Am – AABAN ISLAM</h2>
    <P>I am AABAN ISLAM, a fifteen-year-old student from Khulna, Bangladesh, walking a path that connects curiosity, creativity, and technology. I belong to the science stream, and my passion for learning about computers and innovation has shaped not just what I study, but how I think. From a very young age, I found myself fascinated by how machines, programs, and digital systems work. I would often sit for hours exploring how websites are built, how applications run, or how an AI model can predict things that once seemed impossible. Over time, that curiosity turned into a growing passion, and today, I am on a journey to build a future where my ideas become real technology — technology that helps, inspires, and changes lives.</P><br>
    <p>My journey with computers began quite early. I started by exploring HTML and CSS, the basic languages of the web. I remember the first time I wrote a simple “Hello World” in HTML — it felt like opening a door to a new universe. Slowly, I moved into JavaScript to make websites interactive, and that led me to explore deeper programming languages like C, C++, Java, and Python. Each new language felt like learning a new way to express my thoughts. C taught me the discipline of structured programming, C++ opened the doors to object-oriented logic, Java introduced me to platform-independent design, and Python made me realize how simple and powerful coding can be. These languages are not just tools to me — they are like different voices through which I can talk to machines.</p><br>
    <p>Alongside programming, I also developed strong skills in design and creativity. I became interested in video editing and graphic design, learning how to tell stories visually. I have designed logos and graphics, and worked on editing videos that bring emotions, messages, and stories together. Creativity, I believe, is not separate from technology — they complement each other. A good developer must also think like a designer, and a good designer must understand the logic behind technology. I always try to bring that balance in everything I create.</p><br>
    <p>In my school life, I have chosen Computer Studies as one of my main subjects under the science group. I believe that understanding how computers think, process information, and solve problems is one of the most powerful skills of this generation. While many of my friends spend time just using technology, I find joy in building it, breaking it, and rebuilding it again. I like to understand the “why” behind everything — why a program runs, why a design looks appealing, why a system fails, and how to make it better. That kind of mindset has made me not just a student, but a young explorer in the digital world.</p><br>
    <p>One of my biggest dreams is to build a fighting drone — a drone that can be used for self-defense, rescue, or even competition. I have always been inspired by how machines can be given intelligence and movement. The idea of combining robotics, sensors, and artificial intelligence excites me deeply. I have already started learning about how drones work, how to control them using microcontrollers, and how to program their flight logic. It’s a big dream for someone my age, but I believe big dreams are what push us to grow. I want to design a drone that can think and act smartly, maybe even using AI vision to detect and respond to its surroundings. For me, that would be a major step toward blending my knowledge of programming and hardware.</p><br>
    <p>My passion doesn’t stop at coding or robotics. I am also learning about marketing and sales because I believe building a great product is only half the journey — the other half is bringing it to people. I want to understand how to build a brand, how to sell a product effectively, and how to connect emotionally with customers. Whether it’s a tech product or a digital service, marketing teaches how to tell its story to the world. I see marketing as another form of creativity — one that combines psychology, communication, and design. I’ve been learning how to sell products online, how to promote through social media, and how to build customer trust. I want to combine my technical side with business knowledge so that I can not only invent but also inspire.</p><br>
    <p>Right now, I am also working on a fruit-selling website, which introduces different kinds of fruits like bananas, apples, and more. The website has an online market system where users can see fruit details and prices — though at the moment, it’s visible only to me. The project is small, but it’s special because it connects technology with real life. It teaches me how online stores work — from user interface design to backend data handling. It also makes me realize that technology can support local businesses and farmers, not just big corporations. One day, I hope to make this website public and help people from my area buy fresh fruits easily online.</p><br>
    <p>Learning English has also been an important part of my growth. I took an IELTS mock test recently and scored 6.5, which motivates me to keep improving. I believe that English is not just a language but a tool to connect globally — to learn from international resources, communicate with developers worldwide, and even study abroad someday. My dream is to use my skills to work on international projects, collaborate with innovators around the world, and bring that knowledge back to Bangladesh.</p><br>
    <p>I love challenges because they make me stronger. Whether it’s fixing an error in code, solving a math problem, or improving my design, I enjoy the process of learning and improving. Every time I fail, I treat it as a lesson, not a loss. My parents, teachers, and friends have been my support system, but I also rely on my own determination. I spend a lot of time learning through online courses, YouTube tutorials, and practice projects. I believe the best learning happens when you create something new every day — even if it’s small.</p><br>
    <p>Looking ahead, my dream is to become a full-stack developer, AI engineer, and entrepreneur. I want to build real-world solutions that help people live better, smarter, and safer lives. I also want to teach others someday — to share what I’ve learned, inspire younger students, and show them that technology is not something to fear, but to explore. The world is changing fast, and I want to be one of those who drive that change forward.</p><br>
    <p>I am still young, still learning, still making mistakes — but I am proud of my journey. Every piece of code I write, every design I finish, every idea I imagine takes me one step closer to the person I want to become. I may be from a small city like Khulna, but my dreams are global. I believe that with hard work, passion, and continuous learning, no dream is too big to chase. This is who I am — a learner, a creator, a dreamer, and a builder of the future.</p><br>
